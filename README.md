# Shield Utils
Simple Minecraft datapack for enabling/disabling shields for specific players.

Any players with the tag "shield_disabled" will be unable to use shields in their mainhand or offhand.  
This can be used to create custom extended cooldowns for shields or to disable them entirely for specific players.
